Here comes the version [0.2.3][release] of Facette, containing the following
bugfixes:

* Fix issue in InfluxDB connector with unescaped series names
* Fix missing titles in collection graphs listing
* Fix relations update with collections parents
* Fix issue with graph draw queue failing to propagate time spans
* Fix InfluxDB 1.8 client result backend support

The development is still focused on stabilizing the backend and refactoring
the UI code to improve its maintainability. We hope to come with news and a
preview of our work on January. Stay tuned :)
